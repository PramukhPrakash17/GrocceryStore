# Roles and responsibilities of team members

# Manu Janardhana

## Service Development (Node.js, REST APIs)
- The Auth Service (for authorization) and User Service (for user data) were developed following the MVC pattern, with REST APIs for each.
- Swagger was integrated for API documentation.

## Auth Service
- JWT tokens with asymmetric encryption (digital signatures) were used for secure authorization.
- User roles were included in tokens to control access.
- The service made internal REST calls to the User Service to verify user data.

## User Service
- Endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) were provided to manage user information.
- Email verification was added during signup to confirm valid emails.
- Users could only manage their own data, while deletion was restricted to administrators.
- The service used REST calls for data retrieval and updates.

## Additional Features & Tools
- A logger with a correlation ID was added to trace logs across services.
- A rate limiter was included to prevent excessive requests.
- Jest tests were written for both services to ensure functionality.

##  Docker Integration
Both **AuthServices** and **UserServices** are containerized to ensure easy deployment and scalability:
- Created Docker images for each microservice.
- Docker Compose was used to make services run in "one network" services and link them within a shared network.

## Project Setup & Git Management
- The project was initialized in Git with rules for commit messages.
- Pull Requests were checked to maintain clean code; any that did not follow standards were changed or reverted.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Packages Used**: JWT, winston-elasticsearch, express-rate-limit, mongoose, jest
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Containerization**: Docker

##  ProductService
Provides CRUD operations for managing products, along with enhanced security and performance measures.

**Key Features:**
- **CRUD Operations**:  
  - Endpoints to create, read, update, and delete product information.  
  - Product images are stored in the database as byte arrays.  
  - GET endpoints are accessible to any authenticated user.  
  - POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints are restricted to users with the `admin` or `order_service` roles.
- **Search Functionality**: Endpoints for fetching products by name or category.
- **Security Enhancements**:  
  - **JWT Token Validation** using Public Key (asymmetric encryption) to verify signatures.  
  - **Role-Based Access Control** to protect specific endpoints.  
  - **Rate Limiting** to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- **Global Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with meaningful response messages and logging.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows the MVC pattern for better maintainability and scalability.

##  PaymentService
Handles payment processing using Stripe and securely manages payment details.

**Key Features:**
- **Stripe Integration**: Provides seamless and efficient payment processing.
- **Payment Data Management**: Endpoints to store payment transaction details in the database.
- **Security**:
  - **JWT Token Validation** for verifying requests.
  - **Role-Based Access Control** to safeguard endpoints.

##  Docker Integration
Both **ProductService** and **PaymentService** are containerized to ensure easy deployment and scalability:
- Created Docker images for each microservice.
- Docker Compose was used to make services run in "one network"

## Team Management
- Led a team of **4 members**.
- Conducted **daily stand-up** meetings to track progress.
- Assigned tasks, monitored progress, and ensured timely delivery.

##  Technologies and Tools Used
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Maven
- **Security & Logging**: JWT, SLF4J
